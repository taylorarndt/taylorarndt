# Hey, I'm Taylor

COO at [Techopolis](https://github.com/techopolis-group). Developer and accessibility specialist based in Texas. I build AI agent teams that write code the way it should be written -- accessible, modern, and correct from the start.

I have been learning Swift for less than two years and building in public the whole way. Contributions to my projects are genuinely welcome.

## What I'm Building

### [A11y Agent Team](https://github.com/taylorarndt/a11y-agent-team)

19 accessibility agents for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Desktop. They enforce WCAG 2.2 AA compliance so AI coding tools stop generating inaccessible code. One-liner install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorarndt/a11y-agent-team/main/install.sh | bash
```

### [Swift Agent Team](https://github.com/taylorarndt/swift-agent-team)

9 specialized Swift agents for Claude Code. Swift 6.2 concurrency, Apple Foundation Models, on-device AI, SwiftUI, mobile accessibility, security, testing, and App Store compliance -- enforced on every prompt. One-liner install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorarndt/swift-agent-team/main/install.sh | bash
```

## How I Work

I use AI as a support system, not a shortcut. I build agent teams because I got tired of AI tools writing code that ignores accessibility, uses outdated patterns, and skips concurrency safety. These agents fix that.
