# Hey, I am Taylor.

COO at [Techopolis](https://github.com/techopolis-group). Developer. Based in Texas.

I build things with AI. Not wrappers around APIs. Not prompt templates. Actual agent teams -- groups of specialized AI agents that review each other's work and enforce real standards. The kind of tooling I wish existed when I started.

I am blind. I use VoiceOver and AI tools every single day. That is not a limitation. That is context. It is why accessibility is never optional in anything I ship.

## What I am Working On

**AI agent teams.** I build specialized agent teams for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot. One team handles web accessibility. Another handles Swift. Each agent has deep knowledge of one domain and does not forget it. They catch what a general model misses.

**On-device AI.** I care a lot about running models locally. MLX Swift, Core ML, llama.cpp, Apple Foundation Models. Privacy matters. Latency matters. Offline capability matters. The best AI features are the ones that never leave your device.

**Swift.** I have been writing Swift for less than two years. I am building a Swift library called SwiftDocX for working with .docx files programmatically. I am also deep into Swift 6.2 concurrency, SwiftUI, and the new Foundation Models framework. Learning in public the whole way.

**Accessibility tooling.** This is the thread that runs through everything. If your AI tool writes a button without a label, it is broken. I build the tools that fix that.

**3D printing.** I design and print things. Just code, a printer, and whatever I can imagine.

## Projects

[**A11y Agent Team**](https://github.com/taylorarndt/a11y-agent-team) -- 19 accessibility agents for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Desktop. WCAG 2.2 AA enforcement so AI stops generating inaccessible code.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorarndt/a11y-agent-team/main/install.sh | bash
```

[**Swift Agent Team**](https://github.com/taylorarndt/swift-agent-team) -- 9 Swift agents for Claude Code. Concurrency, Foundation Models, on-device AI, SwiftUI, security, testing, App Store compliance.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorarndt/swift-agent-team/main/install.sh | bash
```

[**SwiftDocX**](https://github.com/Techopolis/SwiftDocX) -- A Swift library for creating and reading .docx files. Pure Swift. No dependencies. Built at Techopolis.

[**Dictate**](https://github.com/taylorarndt/dictate) -- Voice-to-text for Mac. Completely on device. No cloud. No subscriptions.

## What I Use

Claude Code, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Xcode, VoiceOver. Swift, Python, TypeScript.

## Contributing

I am still early in my Swift journey. If you know patterns I have not covered, frameworks I should add, or mistakes my agents make -- open an issue or a PR. I want these tools to be better than what I could build alone. That is the whole point of open source.
